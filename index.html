                            I've been meaning to make the game look prettier, all this coding with the terrain has been a bit of a struggle and I wanted to shift focus for a while. Anyways, here's a small update with Clouds and an improved skybox.

                            I have been working on adding some controller support for my game. So far I have added some basic support for movement and camera navigation and even some interaction with the terrain. I have also added a couple of icons for the buttons and also made the instruction system display appropriate controls when using a keyboard and mouse and when using a controller.

                            I am currently working on optimizing the game, mainly focusing on performance at the moment. I've had
                            some problems with hitching when removing or placing blocks and that's what I am trying to adress at the moment.<br><br>
                            I have added a couple of new blocks, such as planks, sand, cobblestone and logs. Moreover, I have tweaked the noise function to get better-looking terrain as well.<br><br>

                            Finally, I updated the website and added this sort of "flow" layout, I hope it's easy to understand and to use. I also added a rad background :)
