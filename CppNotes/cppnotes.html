        <p>This is a private project created by me (Richard Gustafsson). It's intended to be used as a guide when programming in C++. Maybe one day this will be published on some domain somewhere in the world. Who knows?<br><br>In actuality, I have probably spent more time designing this "small" project than I have been trying to learn C++.</p>

                    <p>Classes in C++ are very similar to classes in C# or Java. Public and private members are grouped together as seen below. There is no real equivalent to a "property" like in C#, instead you would need dedicated getter and setter functions as those below.</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
class Person
{
    private:
        string _name; 
        Sex _sex;
        int _age;
    public:
        Person(string name, int age, Sex sex)
        {
            _name = name;
            _age = age;
            _sex = sex;
        }
    
    string Display() //Return a "display name" of sorts
    {
        return _name + " is a " + to_string(_age) + "-year-old " + SexMap.at(_sex);
    }
};
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Classes can generally be instantiated in two ways: <br><br><br><span class="note">First method, using pointers and a dereferencer</span></p>
                    
                    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
Person *myPerson = new Person("Naomi", 20, Sex::Female);
                    </code></pre>
                    
                    <p><span class="note">Second method, without using the "new" keyword</span></p>
                    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
Person myPerson = Person("Naomi", 20, Sex::Female);
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>Other than looking somewhat different, this actually changes how we access functions and such inside the object. To access properties and functions we can do this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
//When using the first method. Uses arrow instead of a dot since it's technically a dereferenced pointer:
myPerson->Display();

//When using the second method, the "normal" way:
myPerson.Display();
                    </code></pre>

                    <div id="pointers" class="anchor no-select">.</div>
                    <h1 class="subject-title">Pointers <span class="category">Memory management</span></h1>
                    <p>Pointers are weird. They do serve some kind of purpose, though, I guess. A pointer is like a variable, it's just that it can only contain the memory address of another variable.<br><br>Consider the following code:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
int myInt = 8;
void* ptr = &myInt;
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>What does this do? We create a normal integer with a value of 8. But the next line looks a little strange, doesn't it?<br>First, we specify the type of the variable as normal, followed by an asterisk. I don't know why there's an asterisk there but it's just what you do when you create pointers.<br><br>Then, we give the pointer the name of "ptr" and assign it to "&myInt" which returns the memory address of the "myInt" variable.
                        When we add the ampersand sign (&) before any variable we get the memory address of that variable. It is worth noting that when creating instances of custom classes we get back a pointer if we use the "new" keyword like this:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
Person *myPerson = new Person("Mike", 32, Sex::Male);                            
                        </code></pre>
