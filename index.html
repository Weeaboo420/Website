                            I am currently working on optimizing the game, mainly focusing on performance at the moment. I've had
                            some problems with hitching when removing or placing blocks and that's what I am trying to adress at the moment.<br><br>
                            I have added a couple of new blocks, such as planks, sand, cobblestone and logs. Moreover, I have tweaked the noise function to get better-looking terrain as well.<br><br>

                            Finally, I updated the website and added this sort of "flow" layout, I hope it's easy to understand and to use. I also added a rad background :)
